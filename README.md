# üê¶ X (Twitter) Clone ‚Äî Web Dev Project 3

This is my **third project** in web development ‚Äî a simple clone of **X (formerly Twitter)** built using **HTML** and **Tailwind CSS**.

## ‚ú® What makes it special?

I made this without watching a **single YouTube tutorial**.  
No code copying. No shortcuts. Just me, Tailwind docs, and pure vibes.

It was part of a course, but I went full solo mode to build it without watching any youtube video.

## How to run it

Clone the repo and open `index.html` in your browser.

```bash
git clone link
cd your-repo-folder
# Double-click index.html or open it manually
```

## Tech Stack
HTML, Tailwind CSS


Let me know your GitHub repo link and I‚Äôll plug that in too. Or if you want to add images/screenshots, I can write that part as well.
